🏰 A once majestic fortress has fallen victim to neglect and vice. Its ruler, a tycoon lost in a fog of guilt and regret, receives a final warning: in 10 days, disaster will strike...

🔹 Control the destiny of the fortress
   Take on the role of an unusual hero: a charismatic but fractured man. Every day is a chance to change the future. Listen to the residents' petitions, make difficult decisions, and maintain the delicate balance between goodwill and strategic calculation.

🔹 Keep an eye on resources
   Stockpiles of food, influence and loyalty are running low. Anything you say or do will affect relations with the inhabitants. At what cost is it worth saving the castle - and is it even worth it?

🔹 Complete quests and uncover secrets
   Each day brings a new challenge. A witch predicts omens, a captain demands discipline, a daughter doubts you. Will you be able to earn their trust? The game day is limited - you won't be able to help everyone. Choose who to save and who to leave out.

🔹 Accept your fate
   The tenth day will come. The outcome is a mirror of your decisions. Will you be able to turn the tide of fate... or will you fall with the ruined fortress?
