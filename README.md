<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A once majestic fortress has fallen victim to neglect and vice. Its ruler, a tycoon lost in a fog of guilt and regret, receives a final warning: in 10 days, disaster will strike...

**Control the destiny of the fortress** Take on the role of an unusual hero: a charismatic but fractured man. Every day is a chance to change the future. Listen to the residents' petitions, make difficult decisions, and maintain the delicate balance between goodwill and strategic calculation.

**Keep an eye on resources** Stockpiles of food, influence and loyalty are running low. Anything you say or do will affect relations with the inhabitants. At what cost is it worth saving the castle - and is it even worth it?

**Complete quests and uncover secrets** Each day brings a new challenge. A witch predicts omens, a captain demands discipline, a daughter doubts you. Will you be able to earn their trust? The game day is limited - you won't be able to help everyone. Choose who to save and who to leave out.

**Accept your fate** The tenth day will come. The outcome is a mirror of your decisions. Will you be able to turn the tide of fate... or will you fall with the ruined fortress?
